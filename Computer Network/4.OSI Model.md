## OSI MODEL
---
OSI- Open System Interconnection. 
- A & layer arch. with each layer having specific functionality to perform.
- All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe.

### **1. #Physical-Layer (Layer 1) :**
- The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. 
- It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. 
- The physical layer contains information in the form of **bits.**
- It is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. 
- When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together.

#### Functions of Physical Layer

1.  **Bit synchronization:** The physical layer provides the synchronization of the bits by providing a clock. This clock controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at bit level.
2.  **Bit rate control:** The Physical layer also defines the transmission rate i.e. the number of bits sent per second.
3.   **Physical topologies:** Physical layer specifies the way in which the different, devices/nodes are arranged in a network i.e. bus, star, or mesh topology.
4.  **Transmission mode:** Physical layer also defines the way in which the data flows between the two connected devices. The various transmission modes possible are Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex.
5. **Line Configuration:** It defines the way how two or more devices can be connected physically.



> * Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables are Physical Layer devices. 
>
>** Network Layer, Data Link Layer, and Physical Layer are also known as **Lower Layers** or **Hardware Layers**.

### **2.  #Data-Link-Layer (DLL) (Layer 2) :**
- The data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message. 
- The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer. 
- When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address.

	Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:  

	1.  #**Logical Link Control** (LLC):  controls the synchronization, flow control, and error-checking functions of the data link layer.
		-   It is responsible for transferring the packets to the Network layer of the receiver that is receiving.
		-   It identifies the address of the network layer protocol from the header.
		-   It also provides flow control.

	2.  #**Media Access Control** (MAC): 
		- a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
		-  It is used for transferring the packets over the network.

#### Functions of the #Data-Link-Layer
-   **#Framing:** The data link layer translates the physical's raw bit stream into packets known as Frames. The Data link layer adds the header and trailer to the frame. The header which is added to the frame contains the hardware destination and source address.

-   **#Physical-Addressing:** The Data link layer adds a header to the frame that contains a destination address. The frame is transmitted to the destination address mentioned in the header.
-  **#Flow-Control:** Flow control is the main functionality of the Data-link layer. It is the technique through which the constant data rate is maintained on both the sides so that no data get corrupted. It ensures that the transmitting station such as a server with higher processing speed does not exceed the receiving station, with lower processing speed.
- **#Error Control:** Error control is achieved by adding a calculated value CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) that is placed to the Data link layer's trailer which is added to the message frame before it is sent to the physical layer. If any error seems to occur, then the receiver sends the acknowledgment for the retransmission of the corrupted frames.
-  **Access control:** When a single communication channel is shared by multiple devices, the MAC sub-layer of the data link layer helps to determine which device has control over the channel at a given time.


>_* Packet in Data Link layer is referred to as **Frame**. 
 ** Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines. 
*** Switch & Bridge are Data Link Layer devices.
