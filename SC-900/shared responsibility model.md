## **shared responsibility model**

The _shared responsibility model_ identifies which security tasks are handled by the cloud provider, and which security tasks are handled by you, the customer.

The responsibilities vary depending on where the workload is hosted:

-   Software as a Service (SaaS)
-   Platform as a Service (PaaS)
-   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
-   On-premises datacenter (On-prem)
