# Federated Services
Federation enables the access of services across organizational or domain boundaries by establishing trust relationships between the respective domain’s identity provider. With federation, there's no need for a user to maintain a different username and password when accessing resources in other domains.

![Simplifed view of how federation works](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/wwl-sci/describe-identity-principles-concepts/media/5-federated-identification.png)

The simplified way to think about this federation scenario is as follows:

-   The website uses the authentication services of IdP-A.
-   The user authenticates with IdP-B.
-   IdP-A has a trust relationship configured with IdP-B.
-   When the user’s credentials are passed to the website, the website trusts the user and allows access.

With federation, trust isn't always bidirectional. Although IdP-A may trust IdP-B and allow the user in domain B to access the website in domain A, the opposite isn't true, unless that trust relationship is configured.

A common example of federation in practice is when a user logs in to a third-party site with their social media account, such as Twitter. In this scenario, Twitter is an identity provider, and the third-party site might be using a different identity provider, such as Azure AD. There's a trust relationship between Azure AD and Twitter.
