#Digital-Computer 
- fast electronics calculating machine that accepts digital input and users machine power to provide output.
	- Example- adding/ ALU operations.

		 ****Input is data
		 output is information****
		 
*data is collection of facts & processed data is information*.

## Types of Computers
- Personal Computer/ Desktop Computers
	- Not portable
-  Notebooks
	- Laptops
- Workstations
	- Graphically intensive task
	- used for high end purpose 
		- ex animation, Engineering Applications
- Enterprise Systems
	-  servers/ mainframes 
- Super Computers
	-  Weather forecasting
	- Simulations

## Functional Units 

#Processors 
	- ALU(performs operations).
			- Operands are brought to perform operations
	- Control unit (co-ordinates with Components).
#I/O
	- Input(data).
			- keyboard
			- mouse
			- webcam
	- output(info).
			- screen
			- monitor
			- Printer
#Memory
	- stores information.
	- Primary memory(fast and volatile).
	- Secondary memory slow and no volatile.
	- #ram Memory access time is less (ns).
	- #Memory-access-time time taken to get one word(16bit/32bit).
#Program
- lists of instructions that performs a task and stored in memory.
#data
- Number and encoded character used an operands.
#Computer-hardware
- digital circuits.
- Two states on/off.
#AlphaNumeric-Characters 
- expressed in binary codes (ASCII/ EBCDIC).
