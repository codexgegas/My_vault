## [Etherum] 

* Ethereum is a blockchain that is free to download, and has the ability to be programmed, similar to a computer. Therefore, computer applications can be built on top of it.
* These computer programs run across all the computers that are nodes of the blockchain. These applications are called decentralized applications, running at different systems that are a part of [Etherum] blockchain.
* Ethereum was created and conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin

							--Smart Contracts--

* [Etherum ]runs on smart contracts.
* smart contracts are a peice of code that allows [Etherum] blockchain to immediately transport or move data.
* smart Contracts are set of instruction of and when data should move.
* Once its kept in blockchain, they canot alter it. it makes it censorship.

Decentralized products and solutions built on Ethereum have already [hit market](https://media.consensys.net/get-to-know-the-47-projects-that-make-up-the-consensys-mesh-478b7d3028c1). Companies are finding ways to prevent identity theft, improve crowdfunding, pay musicians more fairly for their work, track food from farms to grocery stores, and many other use cases.
