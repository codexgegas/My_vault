## The Move to Decentralization

There are three main forms of [decentralization], or how authority is transferred. In a post on Medium.com, Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, detailed the following three forms of decentralization:

Architectural (de)centralization  — how many physical computers is a system made up of? How many of those computers can it tolerate breaking down at any single time?

Political (de)centralization  — how many individuals or organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made up of?

Logical (de)centralization — do the interface and data structures that the system presents and maintains look more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm? One simple heuristic is: if you cut the system in half, including both providers and users, will both halves continue to fully operate as independent units?

					          	Key Features 
[Decentralization] (politically and architecturally) allows blockchains to be:

-   Less likely to fail because they rely on many separate components.
    
-   Harder to attack because the networks are spread across many computers.
    
-   Harder for users with malicious intent to take advantage of users who are using the platform for its intended purpose.
- If one node stops working, or even 100 nodes, the blockchain survives assuming there is at least one node up and running. This makes the blockchain very resistant to attacks.
- the [blockchain] does not stop working even if the country's internet stopped working.
