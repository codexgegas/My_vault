## Trust Frameworks and Consensus Mechanisms
- **Consensus**, as a concept, is fundamental to any system where more than one entity is participating.
	- As the Ethereum blockchain aims to include any participant that runs a [[Nodes and Network]], there is a need to quickly reach agreement on whether to accept a new block as part of the chain when it is mined. Without the ability to reach this agreement, the blockchain can not create new blocks
- A consensus mechanism is a set of rules that allows multiple machines that are connected together to work together while tolerating some machines providing incorrect data or failing completely.
- These properties are called *fault-tolerance and resilience*. 
- A blockchain needs a consensus mechanism to ensure there are a set of rules for creating and accepting each newly created block.
