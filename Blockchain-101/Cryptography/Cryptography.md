## #Introduction 
-  From the Greek cryptography translates to hidden writing.
- Use some kind of algo to scarmble the message and share the algo to reassemble it back.
-  eg- Caesar cipher(easy to break)
 **Its used to achieve confidentiality**
---
Public key
- helps to encrypt and is publicly available.
---
Private key
-  helps to decrypt the message and it kept hidden.
- its a one way process.
- almost impossible to hack
---
****this system helps to make blockchain secure and helps Exchange of tokens take place***

# Cryptographic Hash Functions
### #Hash-Function
- A hash function is a **mathematical function that converts a numerical input value into another compressed numerical value**
- input can be of any size
- Deterministic ( the same input gives the same output)
- Irreversible
- Out length is fixed for the selected Algo.
- output changes dramatically with even small input.
- Function is fast and with Low computational overhead.

*Hash Algo used in bitcoin is SHA-256 where as Ethereum uses its own Hashing algo called [Ethash]([Ethash Â· ethereum/wiki Wiki (github.com)](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash))*
