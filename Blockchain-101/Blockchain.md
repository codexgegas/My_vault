## The Brief, Brief History of Blockchain

blockchain was first fully actualized in Satoshi Nakamoto's [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), the underlying component technologies draw from years of research across cryptography, computing, and economics.

 #[Blockchain] is a solution to a problem.
	-Network
	-Database
	-Computer
  
----------------------------------------------------------
-Centralization, or control by a single authority or entity, is a common and pervasive form of governance. Governance refers to principles of organization and power.
-We must trust central authorities, like banks, governments, and other institutions to maintain order and structure within the space they operate.
-This trust is broken when the central authorities can not maintain that order and structure. 
-For example, if your credit card information is stolen from the database of a bank you transact with, the centralization of your information in this bank has been used against you.

-Centralized technology and data allows for both the monopolization of power and creates a security risk.

##  Slient Featues 
* Open System
* Trustless
* Represents value
* Transprent 
* Decentralised

-------------------------------------------------
 ## Use Cases
 * Money distrubution (no middle man) 
 * Crowdfunding (No fees)
 * Public records (Mutli Records immutable )
 * Supply Chain()
 * Many More!
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
						---- Public Network -----
	anyone can connect with internet
	user has access to everything on internet

					---sahred database-----
		any user has accesss to this database which is immutable. makes it trustless system

							------World Computer-------
	* peer to peer nodes which is a computer		
	* helps to run programs like Smart Contracts

--------------------------------------------------------------

## How #BlockChains Works?

![[Etherum.png]]

* lets take Etherum chain
* Every BlockChain contains A networks of Computer(EVM) called as nodes.
* this nodes talk to each other constantly and keeps updated with db from pulic ledger.
* as a user u need an address(username, public key, private key), and connect to one of the nodes using some software
* this netwrok also store a local db and updated Online public data.

--------------------------------------------------------------

## Problems With BlockChain.
Reaching Consesus
	 eg -- i have 10 btc and computer tells i have 5 btc. Who is corect here?
	  --sharing data securley
	  preventing Discrepancies

		The Byzantine General Problem

* Solution-
		* Proof Of Work (Bitcoin, Etherum)
		*  Proof Of Stake
		* delegated Proof of stake
