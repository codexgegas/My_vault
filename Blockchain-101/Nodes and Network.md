# **Traditional Systems/ Internet**
- Tradition Internet is a Centralized System.
	- this means its few servers at location and millions of clients completing the network.
	- people with different demands connect to the same server making the brandwidth demand of that server sky rocket
	- Single point of failure .
	- Concentration of model.
	- #peer-to-peer model.

- Computing Devices connect to network.
- A node is any physical device within a network of other tools thatâ€™s able to send, receive, or forward information.
- PC is the most common example for internet node
- [Modems](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-modem-817861), switches, hubs, bridges, servers, and printers are also nodes, as are other devices that connect over [Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430) or [Ethernet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ethernet-3426740).
- For example, a network connecting three computers and one printer, along with two more wireless devices, has six total nodes.

## Nodes in Blockchain.
Nodes are the gatekeepers of blockchain. #Nodes are where the data of the blockchain lives. Each node stores a full copy of  [[Blockchain]], and communicates with each other nodes to verify its accuracy.

### Few Types of Nodes
**Full Nodes**	
- Store entire blockchain and validate entire database, every single transaction and block.

**Light Nodes**
- stores recent portion of the chain only. they verify blocks and transaction too.

**Miners**
- Miners area nodes who do what's called mining. 
- they are the one to validate every single blocks by hashing and rehashing them while changing the Nounce.
- when done they include it in the bock and send it to other nodes

here each block is local and mined by miner and forwarded it to the blockchain/ other nodes to verify making it a permanent chain of blocks
