# Chain of Block
 *  when this individual blocks are combined with each other forming a chain a blocks is called a [[Blockchain]].
 *  this blocks are Crypto-graphically secured, each block is hashed and the hash value of the next block is the staring value of the other.
 *  if the contents of an individual block is changed then its hash value is changed creating a mutation in the whole chain and gets un-validated the whole chain

## A mutation in block
change in a single block changes the entire block. Making Blockchain a secure system.

***blocks are much more secure because of the linear sequencing. By changing one block, that block and all subsequent blocks are invalidated.***
