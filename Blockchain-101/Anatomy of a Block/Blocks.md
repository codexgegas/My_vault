## Blocks
- The Primary reason for a block is to record transaction. 
-  **Blocks hold batches of valid transactions**  
- Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two.
- Block size are usually limited in order to prevent network congestion.(this number varies from blockchain to blockchain)
- blockchain has a limit of 1 MB.
- Blocks are data structures within the blockchain database, where transaction data in a cryptocurrency blockchain are permanently recorded.
-  A blockÂ records some or all of the most recent transactions not yet validated by the network.
-  Once the data are validated, the block is closed. Then, a new block is created for new transactions to be entered into and validated.
- A block is thus a permanent store of records that, once written, cannot be altered or removed.

A block stores information. There are many pieces of information included within a block, but it doesn't occupy a large amount of storage space. Blocks generally include these elements, but it might vary between different types:

-   **Magic number**: A number containing specific values that identify that block as part of a particular cryptocurrency's network.
-   **Block size**: Sets the size limit on the block so that only a specific amount of information can be written in it.
-   **Block header**: Contains information about the block.
-   **Transaction counter**: A number that represents how many transactions are stored in the block.
-   **Transactions**: A list of all of the transactions within a block.
