Etherum promises something more than just few thousand applications,this blockchain provides sets of interctions to create digital assets of everything from Physical assets to ideas.
This is called [Tokenization]. 

--------------------------------------------------
* Think of a token as a key that grants access to a user to participate in the system in a specific way.

* Tokenization allows for the distribution of tokensâ€”representations of value or the permission to do some actions within an application. 

	For example, a token could represent an opportunity to play a video game or download a song. Tokenizing an application is done on top of the Ethereum blockchain, giving creators of DApps new ways to do business on an open source system.
