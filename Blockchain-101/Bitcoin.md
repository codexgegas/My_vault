 ## Origin of Bitcoin
 The problems with centralization came to a head during the [global financial crisis of 2007-2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008). On October 31, 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto (an alias for a still unidentified individual or group of individuals) published the Bitcoin Whitepaper, titled [Bitcoin]

 #Bitcoin
 -A [Peer-to-Peer] Electronic Cash System
 -its a way of exchanging a currency.
 -[bitcoin] combines [cryptography], computer science and game theory to impliment.
-this help to send money digitally to any person witn the need to centralised imtermediary like bank, to validate payments.
	-[Peer-to-Peer] we are describing a transaction from one entity to another, directly. There is no intermediary the transaction has to pass through.
-Example if u send money to your friend and trough a banking app on your phone , the actual flow of money goes from your account to ur friends account. But if ur friend dosent have the account on that perticular bank then the money can be send to a third party  like a money transfer company like paypal etc.

## Limitations of Bitcoin
-Decision-Making Challenges. One major challenge faced by the Bitcoin network is the difficulty it has faced when making crucial decisions.
-[Bitcoin] Transaction Processing Limitations. [Bitcoin] was originally created to process seven transactions per second. As the digital currency's network grew in size, this limitation proved increasingly troublesome and created steadily rising transaction times and fees.

-[Privacy] In Transactions. While the creator (or creators) of [Bitcoin] wanted the digital currency's transactions to remain private, its design failed to produce this result
-[Bitcoin]'s Basic Design. In addition to being the first digital currency to scale, it coincided with the implementation of the first blockchain, a distributed ledger system that has since generated great visibility.

*With the surge of attention to the Bitcoin codebase and white paper, Vitalik Buterin, a contributor to the community, saw some limitations in the design of [Bitcoin] and began designing an open source protocol starting in late 2013, now known as [Ethereum]. Ethereum also operates on a [blockchain], but Ethereum adds features that extend the features of Bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain.*
