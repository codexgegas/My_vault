### Active Directory(AD)
Active Directory (AD) is a set of directory services developed by Microsoft as part of Windows 2000 for on-premises domain-based networks. The best-known service of this kind is Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). It stores information about members of the domain, including devices and users, verifies their credentials, and defines their access rights. A server running AD DS is a domain controller (DC).

**AD DS gives organizations the ability to manage multiple on-premises infrastructure components and systems using a single identity per user**

Azure Active Directory is the next evolution of identity and access management solutions. It provides organizations with an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution for all their apps across cloud and on-premises. In this course, we'll focus on Azure AD, Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based identity provider.
